	abstract = {With the increasing amount of available data, computing power and network speed for a decreasing cost, the manufacturing industry is facing an unprecedented amount of data to process, understand and exploit. Phenomena such as Big Data, the Internet-of-Things, Closed-Loop Product Lifecycle Management, and the advances of Smart Factories tend to produce humanly unmanageable quantities of data. The paper approaches the aforesaid context by assuming that any data processing automation is not only desirable but rather necessary in order to prevent prohibitive data analytics costs. This study focuses on highlighting the major specificities of engineering data and the data-processing difficulties which are inherent to data coming from the manufacturing industry. The artificial intelligence field of research is able to provide methods and tools to address some of the identified issues. A special attention was paid to provide a literature review of the most recent (in 2017) applications, that could present a high potential for the manufacturing industry, in the fields of machine learning and deep learning. In order to illustrate the proposed work, a case study was conducted on the challenging research question of object recognition in heterogeneous formats (3D models, photos and videos) with deep learning techniques. The DICE project – DMU Imagery Comparison Engine – is presented and has been completely open-sourced in order to encourage reuse and improvements of the proposed case-study. This project also leads to the development of an open-source research dataset of 2000 CAD Models, called DMU-Net available at: https://www.dmu-net.org.},

	abstract = {The term computer-integrated construction (CIC) is often used to describe a future type of construction process characterised by the extensive use of information technology. The key to successful CIC is the comprehensive integration of currently isolated computing applications in different phases of the construction process. Among the several types of data exchange standards needed to support such integration, the standards for structuring the information describing buildings (building product data models) are particularly important. No fully operational building product data models have as yet been formally standardised either on the national or international level, but the topic has been a subject of intensive research during the last few years. Building product data model proposals are usually defined using object-oriented information modelling techniques.

The research which is presented in this summarising thesis was carried out primarily during the years 1988-92 at the Technical Research Centre of Finland. The report begins with a brief introduction to the general background of research concerning CIC and building product data models. Fundamental concepts of object orientation and product modelling are explained in a separate chapter. In order to position the author's research results, the "state of the art" in this research field is briefly reviewed.

The research results are presented against the background of a kernel-aspect model framework, in line with current thinking among several leading researchers in this field. The results can loosely be classified into three distinctive groups: a number of requirements which building product data models should fulfil; specific information structures in building product data models; and the integration of product models with other types of information used in the construction process. The specific information structures which were studied include the abstraction hierarchies used in building product data models, the type object mechanism and information structures needed for modelling spaces and enclosing objects.

The report ends with a discussion of the results, comparing them with the proposals and results of other researchers. Some directions for further research are also outlined.},

In this paper, the concept, characteristics, and applications of “Big Data” are briefly introduced first. Then, the various data involved in the three main phases of product lifecycle management (PLM) (i.e., beginning of life, middle of life, and end of life) are concluded and analyzed. But what is the relationship between these PLM data and the term “Big Data”? Whether the “Big Data” concept and techniques can be employed in manufacturing to enhance the intelligence and efficiency of design, production, and service process, and what are the potential applications? Therefore, in order to answer these questions, the existing applications of “Big Data” in PLM are summarized, and the potential applications of “Big Data” techniques in PLM are investigated and pointed out.},

	abstract = {To be effective, data-intensive systems require extensive ongoing customisation to reflect changing user requirements, organisational policies, and the structure and interpretation of the data they hold. Manual customisation is expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. In large complex systems, the value of the data can be such that exhaustive testing is necessary before any new feature can be added to the existing design. In most cases, the precise details of requirements, policies and data will change during the lifetime of the system, forcing a choice between expensive modification and continued operation with an inefficient design.Engineering Agile Big-Data Systems outlines an approach to dealing with these problems in software and data engineering, describing a methodology for aligning these processes throughout product lifecycles. It discusses tools which can be used to achieve these goals, and, in a number of case studies, shows how the tools and methodology have been used to improve a variety of academic and business systems.},

	abstract = {Software vendors offer a portfolio of applications that can be integrated with each other to form product lifecycle management systems (PLMS). Such systems are implemented to create an integrated product information environment. Product information can take the form of relational data, electronic documents, or both. However, implemented PLMS do not have the same capability to handle product information at the product relational data level and the document level. Due to limited resources, many Small and Medium-size Enterprises (SMEs) have only one PLM application supporting the NPD process at one of these levels. Information needs not met by this PLM application are managed more or less efficiently by complementary means. Which PLM application type should a SME use to start implementing a PLMS? In this article, we make eight proposals distinguishing document-oriented PLM applications and relational data-oriented PLM applications to help practitioners choose and implement the PLM application best suited to their company’s needs. These proposals are illustrated by the comparison of two real cases: one document-oriented and the other relational data-oriented. Overall, this article deals with the complementarity of document management and product relational data management to meet PLM issues in most SMEs.},

Reference standards are applicable to the services and industries which bring innovation and technologies to a fast-growing and demanding market. To obtain perfect control of business risks and performance and to ensure “zero defect”, standards specific to the fields of transport, emergency (IRIS IN 9100 …) and generic standards (ISO 9001 …) are more restrictive. They involve full transparency and rigor in flawless quality management processes and monitoring products. In this field, knowledge management is paramount; it helps improve overall performance of industrial systems by structuring the information assets acquired by the company stakeholders. In a way, it is the substantive development of our research. We detailed the approach adopted to implement the Experience Feedback (EF) system dedicated to the product in the PLM business. We presented a first action with the objective of formalizing the implicit experiences generated following the response to a triggering event. In this work, we mainly considered negative events for which the information to be collected are clearly identified. We propose an approach combining Problem Solving and EF adapting the level of commitment to the criticality or importance of the problem addressed. To instantiate this approach in PLM, we have chosen to rely on the Change Management Process (CMP) because, firstly, it involves changes in product data and, secondly, it usually concerns driving developments for correction or improvement of the technical specifications related to the production process.},

Product management - as the bridge between market and company - has the task to absorb and combine the manifold requirements and make the right product-related decisions. In the process, it is confronted with heterogenous information, rapidly changing portfolio components, as well as increasing product, and organizational complexity. Combining and utilizing data from different sources, e.g., product usage data and social media data leads to promising potentials to improve the quality of product-related decisions. In this paper, we reinforce the need for data-driven product management as an interdisciplinary field of action. The state of data-driven product management in practice was analyzed by conducting workshops with six manufacturing companies and hosting a focus group meeting with experts from different industries. We investigate the expectations and derive requirements leading us to open research questions, a vision for data-driven product management, and a research agenda to shape future research efforts.},

The need for managing new types of product-service requirements for sustainability, traceability and performance have widened the traditional perspective of PLM information to integrate new issues, e.g. service information. In this study we examine how the diverse and through-life requirements information could better be integrated in product and business processes of customer-centric manufacturing. The study is based on a literature review and two case interviews. The objective is to elicit requirements information for Product-Service System (PSS). The study introduces the concepts of product-service system, and outlines through-life requirements in customer-centric business. PSS is a new concept for customer-centric business to improve the performance of sustainability, traceability, reusability and repeatability.},

Report generation using tools to support business decisions is the basis of business intelligence. The number of reporting engine tools makes it difficult for users to choose the reporting engine that is suitable for business needs at the time of making the report. This study aims to compare the performance in terms of usability, compatibility and performance in the BIRT reporting engine, Jasper Report, and Crystal Report. The method used is experiments by directly interacting and reporting activities. The testing process starts from getting a database sample and using the RDBMS MariaDB to get the results from the creation of a report containing information in the report designer. The test was successfully carried out and it can be concluded that the three reporting engines have advantages and disadvantages that are typical in each aspect of testing. BIRT has advantages in usability and compatibility aspects, Jasper Report has advantages in all three aspects, but there are weaknesses in several test items, and Crystal Report has advantages in performance aspects. The test results will provide information and conclusions to the company to determine the reporting engine that matches the needs and supports business decisions.},

	abstract = {Data analysis often involves the comparison of complex objects. With the ever increasing amounts and complexity of data, the demand for systems to help with these comparisons is also growing. Increasingly, information visualization tools support such comparisons explicitly, beyond simply allowing a viewer to examine each object individually. In this paper, we argue that the design of information visualizations of complex objects can, and should, be studied in general, that is independently of what those objects are. As a first step in developing this general understanding of comparison, we propose a general taxonomy of visual designs for comparison that groups designs into three basic categories, which can be combined. To clarify the taxonomy and validate its completeness, we provide a survey of work in information visualization related to comparison. Although we find a great diversity of systems and approaches, we see that all designs are assembled from the building blocks of juxtaposition, superposition and explicit encodings. This initial exploration shows the power of our model, and suggests future challenges in developing a general understanding of comparative visualization and facilitating the development of more comparative visualization tools.},

Looking at the technical literature it is possible to find a lot of ROI's estimation metrics for the evaluation of business strategies, even if after the analysis of the theoretical concepts no one faces with a real implementation of the methodology proposed. This paper proposes a solution, based on the key performance indicator (KPI) method, for evaluating the benefits introduced by the adoption of a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tool in a one of a kind company. The methods have been validated with its implementation into an Aerospace and Defence company (Alcatel Alenia Space), highlighting the improvement created by the implementation of the PLM solution in the everyday activities and showing the system's contribution for some key-process as configuration, change and documentation.},

	abstract = {Energy-saving and emission-reduction (ESER), carbon footprint, carbon labeling, and carbon trading have attracted much attention recently due to severe environmental challenges. One key technology for implementing the above concepts is how to realize the effective quantitative evaluation of ESER. In this paper, the existing ESER evaluation technology and systems are summarized first. It is found that the existing ESER evaluation technology and systems are almost isolated from the existing enterprise information systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), product data management (PDM), and customer relationship management (CRM), which results in the expanding of the enterprise information islands. In order to address this problem, a new method for ESER life cycle assessment (LCA) based on Internet of Things (IoT) and bill of material (BOM) is proposed in this paper. A four-layered structure (i.e., perception access layer, data layer, service layer, and application layer) ESER LCA system based on IoT and BOM is designed and presented, as well as the key technologies and the functions in each layer. A prototype application system is developed to validate the proposed method. The main contributions of the proposed method are: 1) facilitate real-time intelligent perception, and the collection of energy consumption and environmental impact data generated in the entire life cycle of manufacturing by using IoT technologies; and 2) realize effective data integration between the ESER evaluation system and the existing enterprise information systems based on BOM.},

A backtracking method is introduced in business intelligence and decision-making environments to enhance plan failure and risk-taking ability. The steep optimized strategy is incorporated in the ODM-BDA framework to improve the training plan and manage money. The research data provided an essential set of acceptance research for these models in increasing the relative level of effectiveness and performance.The simulation analysis is performed based on true positive analysis, performance analysis, error analysis, and accuracy analysis, proving the proposed framework's reliability.},

	abstract = {This paper compares two data interchange formats currently used by industry applications; XML and JSON. The choice of an adequate data interchange format can have significant consequences on data transmission rates and performance. We describe the language specifications and their respective setting of use. A case study is then conducted to compare the resource utilization and the relative performance of applications that use the interchange formats. We find that JSON is significantly faster than XML and we further record other resource-related metrics in our results.},
